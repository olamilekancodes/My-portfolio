      <Paragraph>
        My journey as a frontend developer began in 2020, during the COVID-19
        lockdown. With the world on pause, I saw the stay-at-home curfew as an
        opportunity to invest in myself, so I dived into online classes on web
        development. What started as curiosity quickly grew into passion, and I
        became a self-taught developer.

        After the pandemic era, I landed my first internship at Adeoye Orimoloye
        & Co, where I worked on the law firmâ€™s website. That experience opened
        doors for me, and shortly after, I joined Sync Skill, a
        Nigerian-Australian tech company. There, I contributed to a B2C web
        application and successfully implemented the Stripe payment gateway,
        gaining valuable hands-on experience with real-world product challenges.

        I currently work at Organogram, an enterprise solutions company building
        HR, payroll, and employee performance applications for organizations of
        different sizes. Each step of this journey has sharpened my skills and
        deepened my love for creating seamless and impactful user experiences.

        Looking ahead, I aspire to work on projects that cross continents,
        building digital solutions that connect people from different places and
        make the world feel just a little closer.
